Good day to all our listeners, today is September 30, 2021, and this is Youth Lens Today. We're here to bring you the top stories of the world, dissecting them with the precision of a scalpel and the clarity of a magnifying glass. Our focus for today's episode ranges from a crucial development in U.S. domestic politics to a significant international diplomatic incident, and finally, we'll delve into an under-reported, yet intriguing, policy-related story. 

To kick things off, we are focusing on the United States, specifically on the Biden administration's ambitious plan to raise corporate tax from 21% to 28%. A move that has sparked both applause and criticism. This tax increase is an integral part of the administration's broader $3.5 trillion budget plan aimed at revamping the economy and addressing income inequality. The implications of this move are vast. It is expected to affect businesses of all sizes, impacting their profit margins, and potentially their ability to invest and create new jobs. However, the increase in tax revenue will be used to fund benefits for families, education, and climate change initiatives. The debate over this tax increase underscores the tension between economic growth and social equity, a tension that is at the heart of American politics.

Now, let's shift our attention to the international front. In a significant diplomatic development, France has recalled its ambassadors from the U.S. and Australia in protest against a new defense pact known as AUKUS. The pact, announced by the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, involves the sharing of advanced technologies to help Australia build nuclear-powered submarines. France, which had been negotiating its own submarine deal with Australia, viewed this move as a stab in the back. The resulting diplomatic fallout is an important reminder of the delicate balance of power and alliances in international politics. The AUKUS pact could potentially reshape power dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region, with implications for countries like China and Indonesia.

Turning to a more offbeat, yet policy-relevant story, this week, the city of Austin, Texas, has passed an ordinance to make restaurants recycle and compost food waste. The policy, which is reportedly the first of its kind in the southern U.S., is expected to divert thousands of tons of food scraps from landfills every year. While the policy is being hailed as a significant step towards sustainability, it has drawn concerns from restaurant owners worried about the cost of compliance. This development highlights the intersection of environmental policy and local business interests, a theme that is likely to become increasingly important as cities around the world grapple with the challenges of climate change.

As we wind down today's episode, it's clear that from the corridors of power in Washington D.C. and Paris, to the bustling restaurants of Austin, Texas, policy decisions continue to shape our world in profound ways. The stories we've discussed today underscore the complexity and interconnectedness of our world, and the significant impact that policy decisions can have on our lives, whether it's the tax we pay, the alliances our countries form, or even how our leftovers are disposed of.

Thank you for joining us today on Youth Lens Today. Remember to follow us wherever you get your podcasts and stay informed about the world around you. We encourage you to reflect on these stories, dig deeper, and explore the numerous ways in which policy and current events intersect with your life. Until next time, this is Youth Lens Today.
